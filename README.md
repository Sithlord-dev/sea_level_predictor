# Sea level prediction

In this project, we anaylize a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880 in order to predict the sea level change through the year 2050. We use `pandas` to import the data from `epa-sea-level.csv` and `matplotlib` and `linregress` from `scipi.stats` to get the slope and y-intercept of the line of best fit. We then create a scatter plot with the line through the year 2050 to predict the sea level rise in 2050 and observe the rate of rise since the year 2000.
